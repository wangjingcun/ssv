# SSV - Secret Shared Validator

SSV is a protocol for distribuiting an eth2 validator key between multiple operators governed by a consensus protocol (Istanbul BFT).

### TODO
[\\] Free standing, reference iBFT Go implementation
[\\] SSV specific iBFT implementor
[\\] Port POC code to Glang\
[ ] Single standing instance running with Prysm's validator client\
[ ] Networking and discovery\
[\\] db, persistance and recovery\
[ ] Multi network support (being part of multiple SSV groups)\
[X] Key sharing\
[ ] Documentation\
[ ] Phase 1 changes\
[ ] Audit

** X=done, \\=WIP

# How to run

`docker-compose.yaml` contains definitions of 3 SSV nodes with its own threshold private keys that are generated based on the 
validator's private key. All needed parameters can be found in `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` files.

The following commands are useful:

```bash 
# Build nodes
$ docker-compose build

# Run nodes
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### The following commands are for building and running CLI:

```bash
# Build binary
$ CGO_ENABLED=1 go build ./cmd/ssvcli/

# Run tool
$ ./ssvcli --help
```
